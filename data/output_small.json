This to Moldova, Kaminski added, flew two Hercules military aircraft and four Casa aircraft.\n> \n> The Polish authorities decided to strengthen the pro-European government in Chisinau and assist it in ensuring a sufficiently high level of public security. Therefore, a shipment of weapons, ammunition and equipment from services under the Ministry of Internal Affairs will be sent to Moldova. These include helmets, tactical vests and protective sets. The decision was made by Minister Kaminski in consultation with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.\n> \n> In support of the pro-European government in Moldova, the interior and administration minister also decided to put Ilan \u015eor, leader of the pro-Russian \u015eORA Party (formerly the Social and Political Equality Movement), on the sanctions list. In Moldova, Ilan \u015eor is wanted by an arrest letter. He is also responsible for organizing pro-Russian street demonstrations, leading to destabilization of the situation in the country.\n> \n> Recall, some time ago, the Polish Police reported on the training that officers from the Central Counter Terrorist Police Subdivision \"BOA\" conducted for uniformed officers from FULGER - the special unit of the Moldovan police. Its purpose was to enhance the skills of the country's police officers in counter-terrorism operations and prepare them to provide security in connection with the European Political Community Summit in Moldova. The workshop, which lasted several days, was attended by selected \"BOA\" instructors (seven police officers), who conduct training for counter-terrorist services in the Police on a daily basis, as well as two police airmen, who constantly interact with counter-terrorists during police executions. As explained even before the flight, Superintendent. Mariusz Olechnowicz, head of the training and combat division of the CPKP \"BOA\" and coordinator of the exercise, \"after theoretical discussion of various aspects of training and security conditions, the Moldovan police officers will proceed to practical tasks under the guidance of our instructors.\" As he added, \"the plan includes classes in shooting training, tactics of combat operations, convoying, protection of persons, including VIPs, and responding to emergency situations during the movement of vehicles with these persons.\"",
